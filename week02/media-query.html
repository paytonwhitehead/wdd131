            <h2>Alma 26:12</h2>
            <p>
                Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself,
                but I will boast of my God, for in his stregnth I can do all things; yea, behold many mighty miracles
                we have wrought in this land for which we will praise his name forever.

            <p>
                But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our
                peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
